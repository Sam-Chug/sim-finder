Sim Finder Notes

TODO:
    - Create lowercase name list from regular name list
    - Experiment from creating regular name list from id list
        - This would save around 5MB of space

v0.2.4a Patchnotes:
    - All features relating to lots have been removed.
        - I would have loved to archive the thumbnails for all 14,000 lots, but this is too big an ordeal for me.
    - Features relating to online play have also been removed.
        - Lot/Sim filters, market watch, job schedules, and the clock, all no longer have a purpose.
    - So what remains?
        - You are able to view the sims you have saved in your bookmark list.
        - In addition, I've archived the data from all 130,000 sims, for your searching pleasure.
        - This means sim bios, and in addition, custom styles will be saved and will now be permanent.
        - I've added a "random" feature to the sim search, so you can truly see how just many sims there were in Sunrise Crater.

    - Added possible bugs
        - I gutted the code, removing anything I figured was no longer useful.
        - In doing so, I likely created some edge cases where bugs can happen.
        - Let me know if anything breaks, I'll do my best to fix it.

    It was a lot of fun creating and maintaining the sim-finder for you all to use. There are not a lot of games out there with the level of
    creativity that FreeSO inspires, and I am very thankful to have been a part of this community. There's really no other place like this.
