- Rewrite TODO:

    Patchnotes v0.2.3a:
        - Roommates data cached on first fetch instead of being fetched every time lot is viewed
        - Offline sim data now cached on first fetch instead of being fetched every time a single offline sim is revisited
        - Fixed townhall mayors not being listed
        - New custom style key for random styles
        - New candy cane block style for december
        - Moved sims clock and active jobs to new panel
        - Head decoration for known staff sims

    Bugs:
        - Sim dates still slightly incorrect
            - Possibly timezone related
        
    v0.2.3a TODO:
        - Center clock bar
            - Make it look less awkward

    Low Priority TODO:
        - Some functions are still out of place (constant refactor)
            - Move all GUI/writing functions to GUI etc
        - Clean up css (constant refactor)
            - Many scrambled and unused classes
        - Change "idList" to "simfinder-bookmarks" in localStorage
        - Make easier to use on mobile
            - Layout is very large, could be much smaller

    Shelved Ideas:
        - Remove (Maybe Hosting) if all sims accounted for
            - Create possibility tree and figure this out
            - Since I've removed the privacy state from the sim panel, it might be better to keep it

    Paid Feature Ideas:
        - Query mods about paid features
        - Animated colors for all elements
        - Custom style panel images
            - Paid feature (check with mods)
        - Support for custom style colors
            - Use 3 character hex
            - Limit inside color range (#222 - #ddd)
                - Text color is either sim-yellow or grey, depending on averaged custom color whiteness

    Possible Features
        - Save rolling average of data saved in localstorage to pull from later
            - May not be most accurate but is at least something
            - Possible uses:
                - Last seen online
        
    Rolling Storage TODO:
        - Save structure
            - Sim ID
            - Time last online
            - Log locations
                - In future, can show graph of msot common landing spots
            
    Side Features:
        - Lot renderer/object finder
        - Music box creator
        - Improved roof art generator
