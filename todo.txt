Sim Finder Notes

Known Bugs:
    - Confetti animation is odd when spamming
    
v0.2.4a Patchnotes:
    - All features relating to lots have been removed.
        - I would have loved to archive the thumbnails for all 14,000 lots, but this is too big an ordeal for me.
    - Features relating to online play have also been removed.
        - Lot/Sim filters, market watch, job schedules, and the clock, all no longer have a purpose.
    - So what remains?
        - You are able to view the sims you have saved in your bookmark list.
        - In addition, I've archived the data from all 130,000 sims, for your searching pleasure.
        - This means sim bios, and in addition, custom styles will be saved and will now be permanent.
        - I've added a "random" feature to the sim search, so you can truly see how just many sims there were in Sunrise Crater.

    It was a lot of fun creating and maintaining the sim-finder for you all to use. There are not a lot of games out there with the level of
    creativity that FreeSO inspires, and I am very thankful to have been a part of this community. There's really no other place like this.

v0.2.4 TODO:
    - Add day age to lots in lot view, or remove birthday emoji from lot list
    - Add roommate bonus to market watch (from top lots api page)
    - Show count of how many sims are at the same job lot (out-of-range locations still match up)
    - Style editor
        - Either in-site or a new repo
        - GUI editor for custom styles
    - Hidden sims show up as being in lot, even when all sims at lot are accounted for
    - Bookmark list and lot list should fight for space, always reach max height if possible
    - Refactor "CleanLink" function
    - New colors:
        - Royal purple (felt texture?)
        - Darker blue
        - Black

Low Priority TODO:
    - Reduce bookmark lookups on page launch
        - Cache name/id pairs of bookmarked sims
    - Make certain elements redirect to a filter
        - Clicking "hidden sims on lot" -> hidden sim filter
        - Clicking job icon -> clicked job filter
    - Some functions are still out of place (constant refactor)
        - Move all GUI/writing functions to GUI etc
    - Clean up css (constant refactor)
        - Many scrambled and unused classes
