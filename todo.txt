        - Make easier to use on mobile
            - Renders very large, could be much smaller

        - Much more comprehensive user-style codes
            - More compact style indicators:
                - start - "sf:"
                - avatar - "a_"
                - header - "h_"
                - body - "b_"
                - separate each and end with ":"

            - Sims:
                - https://sims1database.tumblr.com/archive <- database of an assortment of sims, m/f, many outfits
