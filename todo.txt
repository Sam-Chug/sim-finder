    Patchnotes v0.2.3a:

        - Investigate possible memory leak

                - Raccoon?
        - Cache lot images instead of new fetch each time?
        - Recreate sidebar as bar on top of page

            - Maybe just change backgrounds?
        - Remove (Maybe Hosting) if all sims accounted for
            - Create possibility tree and figure this out
        - Change "idList" to "simfinder-bookmarks" in localStorage
        - Make easier to use on mobile
