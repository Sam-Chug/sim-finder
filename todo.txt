    v0.2.2a TODO:
            
    Low Priority TODO:
        - Support for custom style colors
            - Use 3 character hex
            - Limit inside color range (#222 - #ddd)
                - Text color is either sim-yellow or grey, depending on averaged custom color whiteness
        - Special sim-head for mod accounts (M.O.M.I, D.A.D.D.I, etc)
            - Figure out which head to use
                - Raccoon?
        - Some functions are still out of place
            - Move all GUI/writing functions to GUI etc
        - Bookmark text should match custom style's text color
            - Add class based on block style
        - Add background themes for holidays
            - Should be togglable
            - Christmas - Snowflakes falling
            - Maybe just change backgrounds?
        - Clean up css
            - Many scrambled and unused classes
        - Remove (Maybe Hosting) if all sims accounted for
            - Create possibility tree and figure this out
        - Rename all "short" data to "online", all "long" data to "cache"
            - Issue is some cache data is immediately useful for online judgements
        - Change "idList" to "simfinder-bookmarks" in localStorage
        - Improve market watch
            - Could impliment the rare/event dates list

                - Last seen online
        - Make easier to use on mobile
            - Renders very large, could be much smaller
        - Automatically ping api, update per minute
            - Could get annoying updating while trying to click on index in list
        - Custom style panel images
            - Paid feature (check with mods)
